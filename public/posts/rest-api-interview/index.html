        <h2 id="the-interview">The interview<a href="#the-interview" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>The question was from a fullstack interview. The interviewer asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell me about the basics of REST API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real for a moment. Here was the outline of what happened next in the
interview:</p>
<ol>
<li>I tried to explain in 3-4 sentences about how most of today&rsquo;s REST APIs are
not actually REST APIs based on <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">the definition of Roy Fielding</a>. I state
<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/">HATEOAS</a> as the reason.</li>
<li>The interviewer said I was not answering the question about the basics of
REST APIs.</li>
<li>I tried to gave him what I thought he wanted, roughly: REST API is
REpresentational State Transfer, which is the guideline for an API to
provide interactions with and queries for Resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then he solved the question himself, stating the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST APIs have Status Code, like 200s, 400s, 500s.</li>
<li>They have request body, response body, the type of the request/response body
i.e. JSON or image.</li>
<li>They have actions like <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>&hellip;</li>
<li>Probably some more, I don&rsquo;t totally remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding my &ldquo;today&rsquo;s REST APIs are not actually REST APIs&rdquo; statement, he
stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST is just a <strong>guideline</strong>. People are using REST APIs just fine. Whether
they implement REST fully or not doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
<li>(About HATEOAS) It isn&rsquo;t necessary to put endpoints into the response, people
solve that differently, like using Swagger to discover the API&rsquo;s endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened. Now onto my thoughts after a few weeks.</p>
<h2 id="was-the-interviewer-right">Was the interviewer right?<a href="#was-the-interviewer-right" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Just to state the obvious: I am fully aware that I am no way a senior, and up to
now I wasn&rsquo;t saying that I was right or he was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;the basics of REST API&rdquo; includes an overview of the HTTP
specification.</strong></p>
<p>There are two parts here: REST and API. Here is <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">REST</a>. API is, well, existed
before REST happens. It is the Application Programming Interface, which is fancy
for &ldquo;a way to interact with something&rdquo;. None of which mentions anything about
response body or status code.</p>
<p>If the interviewer wanted to ask about how the HTTP server and the HTTP client
communicates with each other, then the question is about <strong>APIs that use HTTP
as the protocol</strong>, not REST or API or REST API. Quoting <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">the original Roy
Fielding dissertation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Representational State Transfer (REST) style <strong>is an abstraction</strong> of the
architectural elements within a distributed hypermedia system. REST <strong>ignores
the details of component implementation and protocol syntax</strong> in order to
focus on the roles of components, the constraints upon their interaction with
other components, and their interpretation of significant data elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the beginning of the quote, it could be regarded as the definition
of REST. So there is that.</p>
<h2 id="he-asked-the-wrong-question-and-thats-fine">He asked the wrong question, and that&rsquo;s fine*<a href="#he-asked-the-wrong-question-and-thats-fine" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>I get it. He wanted to know how much I knew about &ldquo;APIs&rdquo; since the interview was
for the fullstack position. The question was just too ambiguous.</p>
<p>I already know what you think: <strong>You have to say what the interviewer wants you
to say.</strong> And at the heat of the moment I was aware of that, but maybe I cared
too much and made an essay about REST. That&rsquo;s on me.</p>
<p>With that said: <strong>I still stand by my opinion about the term &ldquo;REST API&rdquo;.</strong>
Here&rsquo;s another quote from Roy Fielding himself about the misconception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based
interface a REST API. Today’s example is the SocialSite REST API. That is RPC.
It screams RPC. There is so much coupling on display that it should be given
an X rating.</p>
<p>What needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear on the notion
that hypertext is a constraint? In other words, if the engine of application
state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be
RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period. Is there some broken manual
somewhere that needs to be fixed?</p>
<p>–Roy Fielding, Creator of the term REST</p>
<p><a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">REST APIs must be hypertext-driven</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article I found the quote on was <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/how-did-rest-come-to-mean-the-opposite-of-rest/">&ldquo;How Did REST Come To Mean The Opposite of
REST?&rdquo; by Carson Gross</a>.</p>
<h2 id="optional-the-outcome-of-the-interview">(Optional) The outcome of the interview<a href="#optional-the-outcome-of-the-interview" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think of the interview: The interviewer was not very nice and was
frustrated about my answer<strong>s</strong> (notice the plural in &ldquo;answers&rdquo;). He really gave
me a <strong>lecture</strong> on &ldquo;REST API&rdquo;. Depending on my view on the topic, you may
choose to discount my opinion but I think my answers to the interviewer&rsquo;s
questions were fair and knowledgable. <strong>He was the engineer on the team. After
the interview, I don&rsquo;t want to work with him not because of the questions but
because of the attitude.</strong></p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s name? FPT Software. No bashing on the company itself though - I
just happened to have this experience, and I will tell the experience. Also I
went to FPT University. Just saying.</p>
<p>Ultimately I turned down the deal because the salary was lower than my current
job.</p>
