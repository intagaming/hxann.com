  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>You know, there are opinions. And you will hear lots of it. When you face an
opposing opinion on something you have a strong opinion about, oh boy…</p>
<p>A person’s opinion tells you a lot about them. And if you observe them over a
period of time, you would definitely see a pattern. Opinions go together. Do
your opinions go together? I think it is, and there is a pattern.</p>
<p>For example, I do consume a lot of English content so I have very strict
standard on English’s pronunciation, about the cultural world in English, about
source of information, about how English-lyric songs should lyrically be, how
those songs should sound, etc. They are in the same group of opinion, and you
can’t change one without living another life.</p>
<p>Now expand that category and you could deduct that person’s entire opinion
range. But be careful; you don’t wanna be called out making up stereotypes. Just
be moderate about your assumptions.</p>
<p>Example: If you think that someone who likes badly pronunciated English songs is
inferior somehow, then it’s probably right. They like bad English songs, so most
likely they are bad at English. They probably have limited ability to search for
information on the net. They will have a hard time dealing with people from
another country. They will not obtain as much knowledge in their field as
someone who knows the universal language. They will have narrower point of view
in life because they aren’t exposed to another different world. They will
probably judge the people from that another world. They like a specific kind of
music that pronunciation-wise sounds awful but insist that the music makes up
for it. Not that this person is not successful, but if you just think about it a
little bit more, you basically just deducted their life out of it: their
thinking, their life viewpoints, their lifestyle, their future interactions, …</p>
<p>Now you probably have faced this situation in your life, which is when you have
to decide if you want to continue dealing with this person or not. Your parents
probably taught you that whoever you play with will make you (or just about any
paraphrase of it). Do you want to become that person? And I’m not saying that
bad English will make bad people, I’m talking about their lifestyle and
viewpoints and behaviors and such. Use whatever language they like, but if they
aren’t the American or Korean or Ukrainian or Russian or whatever people and
they judge them? How else can they learn to not judge other people, or judge
<strong>sensibly</strong>?</p>
<p>Taking any amount of salt to take my point, but just let it sit with you the
next time you think about your friend Bob. Best friend I suppose, but you
probably don’t want to be dealing with Bob in the using-cocaine side of thing.
That might be a bit of a stretch but just dial it down a bit.</p>
<p>Sometimes stereotypes will go a long way, and you have probably done it before.
It’s human nature for human to choose the best choice and I’m pretty sure that
is the fact.</p>
<p><em>About that awful English song, it&rsquo;s a male Vietnamese singer that&rsquo;s like the
only Vietnamese singer that touches 1M likes on a Vietnamese Facebook post, and
of course, his English is fine had he not made 2 English songs. What am I gonna
do? Praise the English song and let people admire the third song just like his
second try? My friends - plurally, yes - responsed to my criticism that the
song was fine, even sounded good, and said that my criticism was invalid
because I was being supreme. Then one guy starts analogously comparing my
criticism with something about my love between me and my girlfriend or
something, with anger and full of opinion enthusiasm. I didn&rsquo;t let him finish
and just quits the Discord server, and never deal with him again. Talk about
what an awful English song can do to a Vietnamese ;)</em></p>
