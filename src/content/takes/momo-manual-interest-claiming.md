title: MoMo's manual interest claiming

MoMo is a Vietnamese wallet app. They have an auto-invest wallet, which is like
putting money in a savings account but more convenient. They used to
automatically claim the interest rate every day, but now they require you to go
into the app each day and manually claim the interest.

Look, I'm not well-versed in this aspect of personal finance, but my interest is
not used to generate more money until I manually claim it. It's a fine place to
get some small money but I'll be bringing my sha-shing somewhere else more
profitable.
