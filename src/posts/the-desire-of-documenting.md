Think, at which point in time do you want to document things?

That's right. *You don't* **until** you need to *reflect* on them.

> But what you mean by "reflect"? Why? I'm living!

You'd be right. Now, do you know the legend, in which that guy suddenly had a
$20 bill in his jacket's pocket? What's the lesson anyway?

## *Wha..?*

*Reflecting*, in my own terms, means to transfer the same energy to others. In
other words, you must **be able to explain** that thingy to people.

Imagine this. You break one's heart. They go,

> Why?

Why? You may know the answer (*just be **sure** to curb your mouth*). Now a week
later you *reflect* on that, except *you don't*.

Are you bad and *rebound*? (please don't). Or did you not **documenting**?

Personal story time: *That's me* (not the rebound part). Though I did talk to
people, so I *was* documenting. By talking about it, I got a second chance to
think about that same thing. And I did **fifteen**, just to be sure. Now that's
what I call a *refreshing* story.

## *"Wastes time."*

Look, you better have your reasoning **and** be responsible. On the flip side is
what they describe *a potato*. Do yourself a favor.

Alright, let me give you an example of "reflecting".

There's a *tippity tappity* point, something the *modern* people called
***"antiquated"***.

Great things charm the whole history, like Mozart and Da Vinci. Then there's
**contemporary education system** to join the conversation.

You can, **today**, [send me](mailto:xuanan2001@gmail.com) what knowledge you
could extract out of 4 years of university that can make you get in the $500 job
interview. I **will** make sure to include that *right in this blog here* for
proper reference. Mark my word. Make sure that it makes you **totally eligible**
to work after **4 years**.

I am to blame when you people ~~teach me~~ **put me in** a **$300/mon** job and
tell me that I need **2 more years**, just in case **4 university years** does
not suffice, to have a position in the industry.

Now where do I start *documenting* this? Betcha knows, I document this **to a
great extent**. About *that school project*, how about asking your grandkid how
they feel about Internet Explorer. Must've been an *exciting* TED talk.

## How much?

*Just enough* to get you out of *depression*, whatever that means.

You see, talk all day and you'll hear words flying,

> Shut up you **f___** piece of dress-wielding **c___** head!

In contrast, don't talk and you'd be a **well-known** middle-class person.

If you want an advice from a 20s, ***well*** you arrive at the right god-damn
section:

*Reflect* on what can be classified as **a milestone** in your conscious
eternity, either to *flex* on it *or* to be a proud member of The Boomers.

## How?

Talk. Or write blogs (oh well.)

> code. You know what, while we're at it, my "professor" wanted me to document
> **get/set** methods. The more you know.)*
