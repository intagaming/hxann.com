Today I came across this:

Maybe YouTube isn't the right thing to "substitute" your degree, and I agreed.
However, you are mixing terms.

In the *context* of learning, the medium are merely a link in the chain. Your
knowledge is the only thing that matters. **A Software Engineering degree
doesn't equal knowing how to actually build a *good* Uber app from the ground
up.**

I've learned countless things that I don't use in my everyday life. Guess what,
you don't use, you forget.

And they call someone who actually values their time *"a dreamer"*.

If you come across a person who knows how to make a full-blown system, and they
learned that from no university, but **multiple** mediums like Medium (get it?),
**YouTube**, Udemy, Pluralsight, Skillshare, Codecademy etc., would you call
them out?

This isn't Medical school. You have to give **context**. 4 years of Software
Engineering means nothing. It's your **knowledge**. *Thank you for listening.*
