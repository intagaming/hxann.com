On YouTube, when clicking _Save_ (on YouTube) or _Add to playlist_ (on YouTube
Music), **they auto selects which playlist to add video/song to based on the
previously selected playlist, and they won't show the title of the video/song
being added to the playlist.**

Just added a song 5 minutes ago. Now I'm switching genre and ended up adding a
fucking hip-hop song into the chill playlist, costing me another 3 clicks
(instead of 2) and 5 seconds. Want a solution? Add a fucking _remember_
checkbox. How many years did it took?
